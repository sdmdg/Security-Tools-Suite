# Security-Tools-Suite

A collection of Windows-based desktop applications designed to enhance data confidentiality and secure file handling.
Developed in Python with graphical user interfaces for ease of use, the suite combines robust cryptographic techniques 
with practical file management utilities.

Applications Included
----------------------

1. [VaultApp](https://github.com/sdmdg/vaultapp)
   - Securely stores files using AES encryption.
   - Allows viewing of image files directly within the encrypted environment.
   - Prevents data leakage by avoiding temporary file extraction.

2. [SecureErase](https://github.com/sdmdg/secure-erase)
